**The Oceanic Niño Index (ONI)** is a measure and classification system used by NOAA to monitor and classify El Niño and La Niña events. 

The data below provides a 3-month running average of SST anomalies in the Niño 3.4 region of the Pacific Ocean from DJF 1950 to FMA 2025 as of 16-05-2025.

Warm and cold phases are defined as a minimum of 5 consecutive 3-month running averages of SST anomalies (ERSST.v5) in the Niño 3.4 region surpassing a threshold of +/- 0.5°C.
